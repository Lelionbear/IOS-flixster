### Notes
9/26/2020 : I redid my flix app as I had initially lost all of my files when trying to upload to GitHub. I am not resubmitting the gif as it is basically the same appearance. 

9/25/2020 : I finished my app however when uploading it to GitHub I lost all my files due to the push not succeeding and then doing a git pull.
I am uploading my GIF as proof of submission however I am literally starting from scratch cause I do not know how to use the source control on Xcode
